CrossPost to Friendika for WordPress

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to cross post to your Friendika account.

**Note, this plugin converts the html from wordpress into bbcode that is used in 2.3 of Friendika.  
The bbcode conversion doesn't handle height and width of an image, so be warned that if you post a very large
image that is resized via height and with attributes, those attributes won't be honored in the friendika post
Will be fixing this in 1.2
